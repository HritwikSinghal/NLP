## Goal
Our goal is to get the basic knowledge of how the algorithms work in real world and how to implement them. We will analyse the words we took from two books, apply pre-processing, and analyse frequency distribution of tokens, create word cloud from tokens with stopwords and without stopwords. We also have to analyse the relationship between word length and frequency and POS tag the words using the PennTreebank tag set. We are using NLTK python library for all the data pre-processing, analysing and POS tagging (PennTreebank tag set comes pre-loaded in NLTK python library) since it will give us very accurate results and will enable us to work with such large text book corpus

## Data description

The dataset we used are two books “The adventure of Sherlock Holmes” and “Alice in the wonderland”. We can get them for free. The input will be the words from the books and output will be according to problem statements. For POS tagging we have used Penn Treebank tag set and we have used NLTK library in python for processing and analysing this data.
